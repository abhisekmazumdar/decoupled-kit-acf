## Linting

This plugin uses [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to manage dependencies. To install dependencies, run `composer install` from the plugin directory.

Linting is done with [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://packagist.org/packages/squizlabs/php_codesniffer) using the [Pantheon WP Coding Standards](https://packagist.org/packages/pantheon-systems/pantheon-wp-coding-standards) ruleset. To run the linting checks, use the following command:

```bash
composer lint
```
